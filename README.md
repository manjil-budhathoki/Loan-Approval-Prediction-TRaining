# CatBoost Prediction Project

This repository contains a CatBoost model and a prediction pipeline designed to work with a given dataset. Below is an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Structure

```

- **catboost_info/**: Directory automatically generated by CatBoost for logging and training info.
- **Datasets/**: Folder containing the dataset(s) needed for training or inference.
- **final_cat_model.pkl**: Pre-trained CatBoost model file.
- **final_submission.csv**: Example output or submission file generated by the model.
- **Predict.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to use the pre-trained model for predictions.
- **README.md**: Project documentation (this file).
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies needed to run the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manjil-budhathoki/Loan-Approval-Prediction-TRaining.git
   cd your-catboost-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Project Files & Usage**
   - **Datasets/**: Place your input data files in this folder.
   - **Predict.ipynb**:
     - Open this notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
     - Follow the steps to load the model (`final_cat_model.pkl`) and run predictions on the provided dataset.
     - You can modify the notebook to use your own data files.

4. **Running the Notebook**
   - Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open `Predict.ipynb` and run the cells step-by-step.

5. **Generating Final Submission**
   - The notebook includes code to generate predictions and save them to a CSV file.
   - Adjust the file path or any post-processing logic as needed.
   - By default, it will generate a file named `final_submission.csv`.

## Requirements

See the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file for a complete list of Python dependencies.
